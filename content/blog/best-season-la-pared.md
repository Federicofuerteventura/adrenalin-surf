One of the most common questions we get is: "When is the best time to come?"

La Pared gets swell year-round — but the character of the waves, the water temperature, and the crowd levels vary considerably between seasons.

## Summer (June – September)

Small to medium waves, warm water (22–24°C), peak crowds. Great for beginners.

## Autumn (October – November)

Our favourite time. Growing swell, warm water, fewer people. Best all-round season.

## Winter (December – February)

Powerful Atlantic swell, cold water (17–20°C), almost no crowds. Best for experienced surfers.

## Spring (March – May)

Variable but often excellent. Quiet and warming up. Good for all levels.
