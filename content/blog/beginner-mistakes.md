We see hundreds of beginners walk onto the beach at La Pared every year. And we love every single one of them. But almost everyone repeats the same handful of mistakes — and the good news is that all of them are easy to fix once you know what to look for.

## 1. Looking Down at the Board

This is the number one mistake. When you're learning the pop-up, the instinct is to look at your feet to check where they're landing. But looking down kills your balance immediately.

**The fix:** Pick a point on the horizon and keep your eyes there throughout the pop-up.

## 2. Paddling with Bent Arms

Paddling efficiency is everything. If your elbows are out to the sides and your arms are bent, you're using maybe 30% of your power.

**The fix:** Keep your arms close to the board, reach forward as far as possible, and pull through the water in a straight line.
