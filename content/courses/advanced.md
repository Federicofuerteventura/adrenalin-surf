Advanced training at Adrenalin is for surfers who are already riding green waves with confidence and want to push their performance further.

La Pared offers a powerful, consistent beach break — perfect for working on aggressive turns, aerial attempts, and barrel riding on good days. Sessions are tailored entirely to your goals.

Whether you want to compete, travel, or simply surf at your peak on holiday — we build a personalised plan and push you in every session.
