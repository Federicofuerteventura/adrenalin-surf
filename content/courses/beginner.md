Our beginner surf lesson is designed for people who have never surfed before — or who have tried once or twice and want a proper foundation.

You'll spend time on the beach learning the theory: how waves work, how to read the ocean, how to position yourself on the board, and the key safety rules. Then we get in the water together and our instructor will be right there with you every step of the way.

Most beginners stand up within the first session. The feeling is indescribable.
