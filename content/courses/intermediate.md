excerpt: Already standing? Now learn to actually surf. Turns, positioning, and wave reading with video analysis.

The intermediate course is for surfers who can stand up on white water but want to progress to green, unbroken waves and develop real technique.

Our intermediate sessions focus on what matters most at this level: paddle efficiency, positioning in the lineup, reading and timing waves, and your first real turns. We use video analysis to show you exactly what you're doing right — and what to fix.

In three hours, you'll feel a noticeable difference.
